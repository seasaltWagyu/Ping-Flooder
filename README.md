# Ping-Flooder
A simple ping flooder that is likely useless with contemporary packet management measures.

I do not condone the use of this tool. This tool was not made for abuse and only for non-harmful experimental purposes. This ping flooder is so bare bones that it probably will not work on whoever you are trying to DoS. The program will open a command prompt and run the script. To stop it, close out the command prompt or use the shortcut ctrl + c.
